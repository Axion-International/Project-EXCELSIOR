# Project-EXCELSIOR

## Description
The Superhero App is an Angular/Spring-based Single-page application designed to allow corporations to maintain a fictional database of superheroes and villains. It provides support for all users, including both fans and heroes themselves, to monitor, categorize, and compare the abilities and moral alignments of heroes and villains as they emerge. Heroes and corporations take this even further, with the ability to create and approve superhero and supervillain teams, helping hero users organize their own superhero teams, and corporations monetize said teams for maximum financial gain. Heroes, teams, and employees of the corporation are allowed to access the database and update information as the world evolves.
